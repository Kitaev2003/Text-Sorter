 'As by lot, God wot,'
 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
 'It came to pass, as most like it was â€” '
 'One fair daughter, and no more,
 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
 A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; â€” 
 A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
 A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
 A very, very â€” pajock.
 A whole one, I.
 About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
 Alack, and fie for shame!
 All flaxen was his poll:
 All in the morning bedtime,
 An thou hadst not come to my bed.
 And I a maid at your window,
 And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
 And dupp'd the chamber door,
 And hath shipp'd me intil the land,
 And his sandal shoon.
 And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
 And on his grave rain'd many a tear. â€”
 And passion in the gods.
 And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
 And we cast away moan:
 And will he not come again?
 And will he not come again?
 And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
 Anon he finds him,
 As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
 As if I had never been such.
 As low as to the fiends!
 At his head a grass green turf,
 At his heels a stone.
 Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
 Black as his purpose,did the night resemble
 Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
 But age, with his stealing steps,
 But as we often see, against some storm,
 But if the gods themselves did see her then,
 But never doubt I love.
 But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen, â€”
 But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
 By Gis and by Saint Charity,
 By cock, they are to blame.
 By his cockle bat and' staff
 Did nothing.
 Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
 Doubt that the sun doth move;
 Doubt truth to be a liar;
 For and a shrouding sheet;
 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy, â€”
 For if the king like not the comedy,
 For some must watch, while some must sleep:
 For such a guest is meet.
 For such a guest is meet.
 For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
 For us, and for our tragedy,
 From another one?
 Go to thy death-bed,
 God ha' mercy on his soul!
 HAMLET.'
 Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
 Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
 He is dead and gone, lady,
 He is dead and gone;
 He is gone, he is gone,
 He never will come again.
 Here stooping to your clemency,
 Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
 How should I your true love know
 Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
 In general synod, take away her power;
 In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
 Larded all with sweet flowers;
 Let in the maid, that out a maid
 Methought it was very sweet;
 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
 Never departed more.
 No, no, he is dead,
 Now falls on Priam. â€” 
 Now is be total gules; horridly trick'd
 O, a pit of clay for to be made
 O, a pit of clay for to be made
 O, methought there was nothing meet.
 O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
 Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
 Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
 On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
 Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
 Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
 Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
 Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
 So runs the world away. â€” 
 So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
 So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
 Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
 Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
 That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
 The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
 The hart ungalled play;
 The instant burst of clamour that she made, â€” 
 The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
 The which he loved passing well.'
 They bore him barefac'd on the bier
 This realm dismantled was
 To be your Valentine.
 To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
 To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
 Unless things mortal move them not at all, â€” 
 We beg your hearing patiently.
 When he lay couched in the ominous horse, â€” 
 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
 Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
 Which bewept to the grave did go
 Which was declining on the milky head
 White his shroud as the mountain snow,
 Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
 Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
 Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
 With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
 With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
 With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
 With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
 With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
 With true-love showers.
 Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
 You promis'd me to wed.
 Young men will do't if they come to't;
'And in part him; â€” but,' you may say, 'not well:
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman' â€” 
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' â€” 
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'
'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' â€” Come, begin: â€”

A Captain.
A Gentleman, Courtier.
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
A Priest.
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A bloody deed! â€” almost as bad, good mother,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A brother's murder! â€” Pray can I not,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A churchyard.
A combination and a form, indeed,
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A document in madness, â€” thoughts and remembrance fitted.
A double blessing is a double grace;
A dream itself is but a shadow.
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
A face without a heart?
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
A hall in the Castle.
A hall in the Castle.
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
A hit, a very palpable hit.
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
A king of shreds and patches! â€”
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month; or ere those shoes were old
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A ministering angel shall my sister be
A more remote part of the Castle.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A murderer and a villain;
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
A piece of him.
A plain in Denmark.
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
A room in Polonius's house.
A room in Polonius's house.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A sable silver'd.
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A scullion!
A second time I kill my husband dead
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
A sister driven into desperate terms, â€” 
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A station like the herald Mercury
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A thing, my lord!
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A very noble youth: mark.
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
A worthy pioner! â€” Once more remove, good friends.
ACT I
ACT II
ACT III
ACT IV
ACT V
About the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
According to the phrase or the addition
Act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
Action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
Acts little of his will. â€” Tell me, Laertes,
Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Affront Ophelia:
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Again.
Against some part of Poland.
Against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against their own succession?
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Ah me, what act,
Ah, ha! â€” Come, some music! Come, the recorders! â€” 
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
Air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
Alack,
Alack, what noise is this?
Alas, alas!
Alas, he's mad!
Alas, how is't with you,
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
Alas, look here, my lord!
Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
Alas, poor ghost!
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Alas, then she is drown'd?
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
All given to mine ear.
All may be well.
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
All welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
All.
All.
All.
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
Altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
Amazement and admiration.
Amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your
Among a mineral of metals base,
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
An earnest conjuration from the king, â€” 
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
An we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
Ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And I am sick at heart.
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I do think, â€” or else this brain of mine
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
And a man's life is no more than to say One.
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And all we wail for.
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And aunt-mother are deceived.
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
And bear it to the chapel.
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And by opposing end them? â€” To die, â€” to sleep, â€” 
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And can say nothing; no, not for a king
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
And carriage of the article design'd,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And could of men distinguish, her election
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
And do such bitter business as the day
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And each particular hair to stand on end
And either curb the devil, or throw him out
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
And even the like precurse of fierce events, â€” 
And ever three parts coward, â€” I do not know
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And for his death no wind shall breathe;
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And for your rapier most especially,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
And gave you such a masterly report
And gem of all the nation.
And hath abatements and delays as many
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
And he to England shall along with you:
And he, repulsed, â€” a short tale to make, â€” 
And hears it roar beneath.
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
And here's some for me: â€” we may call it herb of grace o'
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
And hit the woundless air. â€” O, come away!
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And hurt my brother.
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And in part hi;m; â€” do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And in this brainish apprehension, kills
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
And let him know so.
And let him ply his music.
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And let them know both what we mean to do
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And live the purer with the other half.
And lose the name of action. â€” Soft you now!
And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
And makes each petty artery in this body
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And many such-like as's of great charge, â€” 
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here, â€” 
And my imaginations are as foul
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And never come mischance between us twain!
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And not where I had aim'd them.
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And now I'll do't; â€” and so he goes to heaven;
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. â€” God b' wi' ye.
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And our affairs from England come too late:
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And pious action we do sugar o'er
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
And prais'd be rashness for it, â€” let us know,
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on, â€” 
And put it in his pocket!
And reason panders will.
And recks not his own read.
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And set a double varnish on the fame
And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! â€” Hold, my heart;
And shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
And smelt so? Pah!
And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
And so am I reveng'd. â€” that would be scann'd:
And so have I a noble father lost;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And sure I am two men there are not living
And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And tell you what I know.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And that in way of caution, â€” I must tell you
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine, â€”
And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
And the queen too, and that presently.
And then it started, like a guilty thing
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And then, sir, does he this, â€” he does â€” What was I about to say? â€” 
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
And then, you know,
And there I see such black and grained spots
And there assume some other horrible form
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
And they in France of the best rank and station
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down, â€” 
And thus a while the fit will work on him;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And thy best graces spend it at thy will! â€” 
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
And to the last bended their light on me.
And to the manner born, â€” it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And vanish'd from our sight.
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And we beseech you bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? â€” 
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And what's in prayer but this twofold force, â€” 
And what's untimely done: so haply slander, â€” 
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will not let belief take hold of him
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play. â€” 
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a look so piteous in purport
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And with no less nobility of love
And with such cozenage â€” is't not perfect conscience
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
And you are stay'd for. There, â€” my blessing with thee!
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
And, â€” would it were not so! â€” you are my mother.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught, â€” 
And, after, we will both our judgments join
And, as I think, they have already order
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And, like a man to double business bound,
And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
Angels and ministers of grace defend us! â€”

As it hath us'd to do, â€” that I have found
As it is common for the younger sort
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
As kill a king!
As level as the cannon to his blank,
As love between them like the palm might flourish;
As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
As make your bouts more violent to that end, â€” 
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note
As of a man faithful and honourable.
As oft as any passion under heaven
As one incapable of her own distress,
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
As the indifferent children of the earth.
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
As therein are set down.
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
As thou art to thyself:
As thou'rt a man,

As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As to peace-parted souls.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
Hamlet the Dane.
Hamlet! Hamlet!
Hamlet, Son to the former, and Nephew to the present King.
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, â€” 
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
Happy in that we are not over-happy;
Hark you, Guildenstern; â€” and you too; â€” at each ear a hearer: that
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
Hath sent me to you.
Hath there been such a time, â€” I'd fain know that â€” 
Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
Have after. â€” To what issue will this come?
Have at you now!
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
Have not the skill.
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
Have seen play, â€” and heard others praise, and that highly, â€” not
Have sent for you.
Have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, â€” 
Have you forgot me?
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
Have you so slander any moment leisure
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
He closes with you in this consequence;
He closes with you thus: â€” 'I know the gentleman;
He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he, â€” and
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
He falls to such perusal of my face
He has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He is justly serv'd;
He knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far
He likewise gives a frock or livery
He made confession of you;
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
He never gave commandment for their death.
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
He that plays the king shall be welcome, â€” his majesty shall
He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He was the first that ever bore arms.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
He will stay till you come.
He's fat, and scant of breath. â€” 
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: â€” say on; come
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
He.
Hear you, sir;
Hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. â€” 
Heaven will direct it.
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
Help, help, ho!
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Her father and myself, â€” lawful espials, â€” 
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Here in the lobby.
Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
Here was a gentleman of Normandy, â€” 
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Here's to thy health. â€”
Here's yet some liquor left.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my

Him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

His authorities. But such officers do the king best service in

His beard was grizzled, â€” no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
His crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
His means of death, his obscure burial, â€” 
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
His purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
His replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
His silence will sit drooping.
His wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of
History, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
Hither?
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
Hold off your hands.
Hold up Adam's profession.
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
Holds such an enmity with blood of man

How is't, my noble lord?
How long hath she been thus?
How long is that since?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
How may we try it further?
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
How now! What news?
How now! What noise is that?
How now! what hath befall'n?
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
How now, sweet queen!
How now? a rat? [Draws.]
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
How say you by that? â€” [Aside.] Still harping on my daughter: â€” yet
How say you then; would heart of man once think it? â€” 
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, â€” 
How strangely?
How the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
How these things came about: so shall you hear
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
How was this seal'd?
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Humanity so abominably.
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;

I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
I am dead, Horatio. â€” Wretched queen, adieu! â€” 
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
I am glad to see you well:
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. â€” 
I am satisfied in nature,
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I am tame, sir: â€” pronounce.
I am thy father's spirit;
I am very glad to see you. â€” Good even, sir. â€” 
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
I be so able as now.
I beseech you, remember, â€” 
I beseech you.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I can no more: â€” the king, the king's to blame.
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
I could not but by her. The other motive,
I dare damnation: â€” to this point I stand, â€” 
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
I did repel his letters and denied
I did very well note him.
I do believe you think what now you speak;
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do beseech you.
I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
I do not know from what part of the world
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
I do not think't.
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
I doubt it is no other but the main, â€” 
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I embrace it freely;
I find thee apt;
I ha't:
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
I have a daughter, â€” have whilst she is mine, â€” 
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
I have a voice and precedent of peace
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
I have in quick determination
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
I have seen nothing.
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
I have sworn't.
I have, my lord.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, â€” but it was never acted;
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
I know, no touch of it, my lord.
I know, you are not ignorant, â€”
I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
I made to her in marriage; and to decline
I mean, my head upon your lap?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
I must to England; you know that?
I never gave you aught.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. â€”
I pray you go with me.
I pray you pass with your best violence:
I pray you, give me leave.
I pray you, now receive them.
I pray you.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
I say, away! â€” Go on; I'll follow thee.
I see a cherub that sees them. â€” But, come; for England! â€” 
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey you: â€” 
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
I shall, my lord.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
I should have fatted all the region kites
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
I stay too long: â€” but here my father comes.
I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
I thank you: â€” keep the door. â€” O thou vile king,
I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
I think I hear them. â€” Stand, ho! Who is there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I think nothing, my lord.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
I understand you not, my lord.
I warr'nt it will.
I warrant your honour.
I was the more deceived.
I will be brief: â€” your noble son is mad:
I will bestow him, and will answer well
I will do't, my lord.
I will do't:
I will not speak with her.
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. â€” You
I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
I will say so.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your

I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
I will.
I would I had been there.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
I would know that.
I would not hear your enemy say so;
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
I'll blessing beg of you. â€” For this same lord
I'll board him presently: â€” O, give me leave.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. â€” Stay, illusion!
I'll do't. â€” Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. â€” 
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. â€” 
I'll rant as well as thou.
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I'll visit you.
I'll warrant you:
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,

In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
Most like a gentleman.
Most like: â€” it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Most throughly for my father.
Most welcome home!
Mother, good-night. â€” Indeed, this counsellor
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Much approve me. â€” Well, sir.
Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Murder!
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
Must give us pause: there's the respect
Must render up myself.
Must there no more be done?
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
Musty.
My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
My fate cries out,
My father died: â€” they say he made a good end, â€” 
My father's brother; but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
My father, â€” methinks I see my father.
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
My good lord, â€”
My head should be struck off.
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
My honoured lord!
My hour is almost come,
My leave of you.
My liege, and madam, â€” to expostulate
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I cannot.
My lord, I did intend it.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I do not know;
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
My lord, I have.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, I will be rul'd;
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
My lord, not I.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord, we will not.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
My lord, you once did love me.
My lord?
My most dear lord!
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
My mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
My stern effects: then what I have to do
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
My tables, â€” meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites, â€” 
My too-much-changed son. â€” Go, some of you,
My virtue or my plague, be it either which, â€”

My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,

Nay, come, let's go together.
Nay, do not think I flatter;

Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here

She speaks much of her father; says she hears

She turns to favour and to prettiness.
She well instructs me.

Take these again; for to the noble mind
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:

Take up the bodies. â€” Such a sight as this

Than is my deed to my most painted word:
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,

Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than to entreaty.
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
Than your particular demands will touch it:

That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
That I essentially am not in madness,

That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
That I might be the organ.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
That I must call't in question.
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
That are so fortified against our story,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
That capability and godlike reason
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry, â€” 
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
That ever I was born to set it right! â€” 
That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
That flesh is heir to, â€” 'tis a consummation
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
That from her working all his visage wan'd;
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
That has no relish of salvation in't; â€” 
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, â€” 
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That hath made him mad.
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
That he is open to incontinency;
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That he which hath your noble father slain
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer: â€” 
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
That is Laertes,
That is most certain.
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That it might please you to give quiet pass
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
That live and feed upon your majesty.
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
That makes calamity of so long life;
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
That might your nature, honour, and exception
That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That our devices still are overthrown;
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That she should lock herself from his resort,
That show of such an exercise may colour
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That they may seem the taints of liberty;
That thou so many princes at a shot
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
That thus he suffers for.
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? â€” 
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
That to the use of actions fair and good
That treason can but peep to what it would,
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
That we find out the cause of this effect;
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That you know aught of me: â€” this is not to do,
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That your good beauties be the happy cause
That youth and observation copied there;
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That's two of his weapons: â€” but well.
That's very true, my lord.

There is a play to-night before the king;
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
There is no shuffling; â€” there the action lies
There lives within the very flame of love
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
There with fantastic garlands did she come
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
There's fennel for you, and columbines: â€” there's rue for you;
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, â€” 
There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There's no offence, my lord.
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,

These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
These tedious old fools!
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
They are of Norway, sir.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
They are. To a nunnery, go.
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
They bleed on both sides. â€” How is it, my lord?
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
They had begun the play, â€” I sat me down;
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
They shall go far with little.
They were given me by Claudio: â€” he receiv'd them
They'll tell all.
They?
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
Think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
Think it no more:
Thirty years.
This above all, â€” to thine own self be true;
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This business is well ended. â€” 
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
This grave shall have a living monument:
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
This is mere madness:
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This is the very coinage of your brain:
This is the very ecstasy of love;
This is too heavy, let me see another.
This is too long.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
This mad young man. But so much was our love
This man shall set me packing:
This marvel to you.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
This night to play before him.
This nothing's more than matter.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

This quarry cries on havoc. â€” O proud death,

Thou know'st 'tis common, â€” all that lives must die,
Thou know'st already.
Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Thou pray'st not well.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. â€” 
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Thus much the business is: â€” we have here writ
Thus set it down: â€” he shall with speed to England
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
Thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: â€” 'The croaking raven doth
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Thy natural magic and dire property
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Till by some elder masters of known honour
Till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
To England send him; or confine him where
To Hecuba.
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, â€” 
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
To any pastime?
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
To be commanded.
To be contracted in one brow of woe;
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
To be, or not to be, â€” that is the question: â€” 
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To both your honours.
To business with the king, more than the scope
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
To cut his throat i' the church.
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
To ears of flesh and blood. â€” List, list, O, list! â€” 
To exploit, now ripe in my device,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
To give it due content.
To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
To give the world assurance of a man;
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
To give these mourning duties to your father;
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
To hear and see the matter.
To hear him so inclin'd. â€” 
To hear of it: they are about the court,
To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
To heaven.
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
To hide the slain? â€” O, from this time forth,
To him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
To him from whom you brought them.
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
To keep those many many bodies safe
To know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
To let this canker of our nature come
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To make oppression bitter; or ere this
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
To me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
To me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
To mine own room again: making so bold,
To muddy death.
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
To offer it the show of violence;
To our most valiant brother. So much for him, â€” 
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
To punish me with this, and this with me,
To put an antic disposition on, â€” 
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
To reason most absurd; whose common theme
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
To show my duty in your coronation;
To show us so much gentry and good-will
To show yourself your father's son in deed
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
To sleep! perchance to dream: â€” ay, there's the rub;
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
To speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
To speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
To speak of horrors, â€” he comes before me.
To take him in the purging of his soul,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
To tell my story. â€”
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To tell us this.
To the ambassadors of England gives
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
To the unsatisfied.
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd â€” 
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
To those of mine!
To try conclusions, in the basket creep
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
To what I shall unfold.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
To what end, my lord?
To whom do you speak this?
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
To you alone.
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
To youth and liberty.
To't.
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,

Under the which he shall not choose but fall:

Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

Unto our climature and countrymen. â€” 
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Up from my cabin,
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon my honour, â€”
Upon my life, Lamond.
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon my sword.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the talk of the poisoning? â€”
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon what ground?
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
Upon whose property and most dear life
Valanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
Very day that young Hamlet was born, â€” he that is mad, and sent
Very good, my lord.
Very liberal conceit.
Very like a whale.

Very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of

We cannot get from him.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar

Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Welcome, my good friends!

What ceremony else?

What company, at what expense; and finding,
What did you enact?
What do you call the play?
What do you think of me?
What does this mean, my lord?
What dost thou mean by this?
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
What follows, then, my lord?
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
What hour now?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
What is between you? give me up the truth.
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
What is he whose grief
What is it you will see?
What is the cause, Laertes,
What is the issue of the business there.
What is the matter, my lord?
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
What is't to leave betimes?
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
What is't, my lord? we will.
What is, my lord?
What majesty should be, what duty is,
What man dost thou dig it for?

What, have you given him any hard words of late?
What, ho, Horatio!
What, is Horatio there?
What, look'd he frowningly?
What, my lord?
What, the fair Ophelia?
What?
When I had seen this hot love on the wing, â€” 
When I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the
When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
When down her weedy trophies and herself
When he himself might his quietus make
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
When in one line two crafts directly meet. â€” 
When in your motion you are hot and dry, â€” 
When it prov'd otherwise?
When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
When second husband kisses me in bed.
When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
When thou liest howling.
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
When we would bring him on to some confession
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
Where is Polonius?
Where is my father?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
Where is this king? â€” Sirs, stand you all without.
Where is this sight?
Where is your son?
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where my abridgment comes.
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where should we have our thanks?
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Where, my lord?
Wherefore should you do this?
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
Which have solicited. â€” the rest is silence.
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
Which now goes too free-footed.
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
Which was the model of that Danish seal:
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
Whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
Who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Who commands them, sir?
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is to be buried in't?
Who is't that can inform me?
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
Who shall stay you?
Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
Who's there?
Who, I?
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, â€” 
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
Whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
Whose violent property fordoes itself,
Whose was it?
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Why â€” 
Why â€” 
Why ask you this?
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
Why does the drum come hither?
Why he more than another?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why the man dies. â€” I humbly thank you, sir.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thou art thus incens'd. â€” Let him go, Gertrude: â€” 
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Why, 'tis found so.
Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Why, anything â€” but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Why, he had none.
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
Why, how now, Hamlet!
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Why, now you speak
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
Why, what a king is this!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Why, what should be the fear?
Why?
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Will he, nill he, he goes, â€” mark you that: but if the water come
Will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
Will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
Will not debate the question of this straw:
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Will speak to this fellow. â€” Whose grave's this, sir?
Will take longer time.
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Will you be rul'd by me?
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
Will you know them then?
Will you two help to hasten them?
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
Will't please you go, my lord?
Willingly part withal, â€” except my life, except my life, except my
Winner and loser?
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
With all my imperfections on my head:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
With drink, sir?
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
With this affair along: â€” or all, our thanks.
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With variable objects, shall expel
With what, i' the name of God?
With which she followed my poor father's body
With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, â€” 
With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
With you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, â€” 
Within 's two hours.
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Within the centre.
Without debatement further, more or less,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Words, words, words.
Work: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free
World.
Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
Would have mourn'd longer, â€” married with mine uncle,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Would make them capable. â€” Do not look upon me;
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers â€” if the rest of my
Would perhaps trouble a woman.
Would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. â€” 
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
Wronging it thus, â€” you'll tender me a fool.
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
Years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Yes, faith, heartily.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Yet I,
Yet have I in me something dangerous,
Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
Yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
You are a good chorus, my lord.
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
You are merry, my lord.
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is, â€”
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: â€” I am glad to see thee
You are welcome.
You cannot call it love; for at your age
You cannot play upon me.
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You do remember all the circumstance?
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
You go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
You go not till I set you up a glass
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
You heavenly guards! â€” What would your gracious figure?
You know sometimes he walks for hours together
You know the wager?
You laying these slight sullies on my son
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
You might have rhymed.
You mock me, sir.
You must not put another scandal on him,
You must not take for fire. From this time
