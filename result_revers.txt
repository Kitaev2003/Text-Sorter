Gentlemen! â€”
A king of shreds and patches! â€”
My good lord, â€”
But, my good lord, â€”
O, my dear lord, â€”
[Within.] My lord, my lord, â€”
Nay, good my lord, â€”
Rome, â€”
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine, â€”
The bell then beating one, â€”
Purpose, confess thyself, â€”
The king is a thing, â€”
 But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen, â€”
Matter, â€”
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver, â€”
Upon my honour, â€”
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is, â€”
Now, out of this, â€”
Then came each actor on his ass, â€”
[Within.] Lord Hamlet, â€”
I know, you are not ignorant, â€”
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast, â€”
For husband shalt thou, â€”
Say, â€”
 For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy, â€”
Over the nasty sty, â€”
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. â€”
Here's to thy health. â€”
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. â€”
 And on his grave rain'd many a tear. â€”
To tell my story. â€”
It is not so: â€” it begins with Pyrrhus: â€”
Still am I call'd; â€” unhand me, gentlemen; â€”
Upon the talk of the poisoning? â€”
Nay, but Ophelia â€”
If thou didst ever thy dear father love â€”
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son â€”
The king, sir â€”

Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! â€” 
I see a cherub that sees them. â€” But, come; for England! â€” 
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! â€” 
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! â€” 
And thy best graces spend it at thy will! â€” 
Let me not think on't, â€” Frailty, thy name is woman! â€” 
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! â€” 
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! â€” 
The point envenom'd too! â€” 
Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder! â€” 
Ah, ha! â€” Come, some music! Come, the recorders! â€” 
Angels and ministers of grace defend us! â€” 
No, no! the drink, the drink! â€” O my dear Hamlet! â€” 
That ever I was born to set it right! â€” 
To ears of flesh and blood. â€” List, list, O, list! â€” 
I am dead, Horatio. â€” Wretched queen, adieu! â€” 
'Tis Hamlet's character: â€” 'Naked!' â€” 
Ophelia,' â€” 
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' â€” 
'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman' â€” 
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, â€” 
It was against your highness; whereat griev'd, â€” 
O royal knavery! an exact command, â€” 
I dare damnation: â€” to this point I stand, â€” 
My father died: â€” they say he made a good end, â€” 
As make your bouts more violent to that end, â€” 
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, â€” 
And what's in prayer but this twofold force, â€” 
 The instant burst of clamour that she made, â€” 
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, â€” 
Come on! â€” you hear this fellow in the cellarage, â€” 
And many such-like as's of great charge, â€” 
Like Niobe, all tears; â€” why she, even she, â€” 
And he, repulsed, â€” a short tale to make, â€” 
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table, â€” 
In equal scale weighing delight and dole, â€” 
I have a daughter, â€” have whilst she is mine, â€” 
And much offence too. Touching this vision here, â€” 
 When he lay couched in the ominous horse, â€” 
As it doth well appear unto our state, â€” 
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, â€” 
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself, â€” 
An earnest conjuration from the king, â€” 
Even in their promise, as it is a-making, â€” 
When I had seen this hot love on the wing, â€” 
My virtue or my plague, be it either which, â€” 
But that the dread of something after death, â€” 
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month, â€” 
His means of death, his obscure burial, â€” 
The better to beguile. This is for all, â€” 
 Unless things mortal move them not at all, â€” 
O, step between her and her fighting soul, â€” 
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him, â€” 
To our most valiant brother. So much for him, â€” 
The form of plausive manners; â€” that these men, â€” 
I doubt it is no other but the main, â€” 
Since nature cannot choose his origin, â€” 
And prologue to the omen coming on, â€” 
To put an antic disposition on, â€” 
Many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on, â€” 
No noble rite nor formal ostentation, â€” 
Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon, â€” 
But, orderly to end where I begun, â€” 
And thrice his head thus waving up and down, â€” 
As infinite as man may undergo, â€” 
And by opposing end them? â€” To die, â€” to sleep, â€” 
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, â€” 
I beseech you, remember, â€” 
And what's untimely done: so haply slander, â€” 
Of those effects for which I did the murder, â€” 
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, â€” 
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, â€” 
Being thus benetted round with villanies, â€” 
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites, â€” 
If it be so, Laertes, â€” 
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, â€” 
Your loneliness. â€” We are oft to blame in this, â€” 
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, â€” 
Look here upon this picture, and on this, â€” 
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works, â€” 
Her father and myself, â€” lawful espials, â€” 
A sister driven into desperate terms, â€” 
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, â€” 
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, â€” 
As he is very potent with such spirits, â€” 
And even the like precurse of fierce events, â€” 
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, â€” 
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, â€” 
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, â€” 
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught, â€” 
Of thinking too precisely on the event, â€” 
Is strict in his arrest, â€” O, I could tell you, â€” 
You, as your business and desires shall point you, â€” 
Here was a gentleman of Normandy, â€” 
Out of my weakness and my melancholy, â€” 
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, â€” 
When in your motion you are hot and dry, â€” 
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry, â€” 
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry, â€” 
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, â€” 
To hear him so inclin'd. â€” 
This business is well ended. â€” 
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. â€” 
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. â€” 
Ay, lady, 'twas my word. â€” 
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. â€” 
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. â€” 
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. â€” 
It is a poison temper'd by himself. â€” 
We'll put the matter to the present push. â€” 
He's fat, and scant of breath. â€” 
Videlicet, a brothel, â€” or so forth. â€” 
It waves me still. â€” 
 Now falls on Priam. â€” 
Speak loudly for him. â€” 
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. â€” 
Unto our climature and countrymen. â€” 
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. â€” Pr'ythee say on. â€” 
'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. â€” 
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. â€” 
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. â€” 
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. â€” 
I am very glad to see you. â€” Good even, sir. â€” 
As I do thee. â€” Something too much of this. â€” 
Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't. â€” 
[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't. â€” 
When in one line two crafts directly meet. â€” 
The death I gave him. So again, good-night. â€” 
And will this brother's wager frankly play. â€” 
 So runs the world away. â€” 
Why thou art thus incens'd. â€” Let him go, Gertrude: â€” 
If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see: â€” 
Your memory, begin at this line; â€” let me see, let me see: â€” 
'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.' â€” Come, begin: â€” 
To be, or not to be, â€” that is the question: â€” 
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer: â€” 
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you: â€” 
I shall obey you: â€” 
As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would'; â€” 
Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might'; â€” 
But come; â€” 
Lay her i' the earth; â€” 
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, â€” to sleep; â€” 
 A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; â€” 
That has no relish of salvation in't; â€” 
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; â€” 
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? â€” 
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? â€” 
As how should it be so? how otherwise? â€” 
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? â€” 
How say you then; would heart of man once think it? â€” 
And then, sir, does he this, â€” he does â€” What was I about to say? â€” 
Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? â€” 
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd â€” 
Hath there been such a time, â€” I'd fain know that â€” 
Why â€” 
Why â€”

Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
But bear me stiffly up. â€” Remember thee!
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!

King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!

O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
What, frighted with false fire!
Eyes. â€” Pray you, no more!
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
But break my heart, â€” for I must hold my tongue!

Fare you well, my dove!
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
As kill a king!
Long live the king!
And smelt so? Pah!

How now, sweet queen!
Ay, amen!
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Nay, come again!
But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!

Look, my lord, it comes!
On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Why, what a king is this!
These tedious old fools!
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Lights, lights, lights!
Speak of it: â€” stay, and speak! â€” Stop it, Marcellus!

Hamlet! Hamlet!
Why, how now, Hamlet!

Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!

Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Judgment!
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,
 Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
But let this same be presently perform'd,
And carriage of the article design'd,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
 Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
 No, no, he is dead,
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
 Go to thy death-bed,
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
A combination and a form, indeed,
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
Enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
To mine own room again: making so bold,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
But to recover of us, by strong hand,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
 And hath shipp'd me intil the land,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
[Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
The single and peculiar life is bound,
And, like a man to double business bound,
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
As did that one; and that, in my regard,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Brief let me be. â€” Sleeping within my orchard,
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Ay, my lord,
Dread my lord,
Good my lord,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
 Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
If it be,
 Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Their virtues else, â€” be they as pure as grace,
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
So, by my former lecture and advice,
Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
To exploit, now ripe in my device,
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
For art and exercise in your defence,
That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
Sir, in this audience,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Now cracks a noble heart. â€” Good night, sweet prince,
Importing health and graveness. â€” Two months since,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
 A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
For what advancement may I hope from thee,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Thou know'st 'tis common, â€” all that lives must die,
Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
Would have mourn'd longer, â€” married with mine uncle,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
Depriv'd thee of! â€” Hold off the earth awhile,
Sit down awhile,
As to expend your time with us awhile,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
To punish me with this, and this with me,
If it be so, â€” as so 'tis put on me,
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
Pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
Transports his poison'd shot, â€” may miss our name,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
But that I know love is begun by time,
 All in the morning bedtime,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
My hour is almost come,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
If there be any good thing to be done,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
 He is gone, he is gone,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
 On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
But to my mind, â€” though I am native here,
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
 To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
For every man hath business and desire,
 And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
 'One fair daughter, and no more,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
I am satisfied in nature,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Among a mineral of metals base,
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or, â€” not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
Brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
 Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The time is out of joint: â€” O cursed spite,
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
 To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
In youth when I did love, did love,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
So much from the understanding of himself,
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Whose violent property fordoes itself,
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
 At his head a grass green turf,
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
What company, at what expense; and finding,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
I thank you: â€” keep the door. â€” O thou vile king,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
Most generous, and free from all contriving,
Nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
Plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
 Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
Had I but time, â€” as this fell sergeant, death,
This quarry cries on havoc. â€” O proud death,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
In faith,
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Giving more light than heat, â€” extinct in both,
Heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
To hide the slain? â€” O, from this time forth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Not from his mouth,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
Alack,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
History, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
 Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Last night of all,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
 A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
No traveller returns, â€” puzzles the will,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
You must not put another scandal on him,
 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
 Anon he finds him,
Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! â€” I knew him,
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
At last, â€” a little shaking of mine arm,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
 But as we often see, against some storm,
 The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
Did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
As thou'rt a man,
Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
 But if the gods themselves did see her then,
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! â€” So, gentlemen,
Come hither, gentlemen,
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
 And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
 Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
Sleep rock thy brain,
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Up from my cabin,
And, as the world were now but to begin,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
By this encompassment and drift of question,
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
About the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
If it assume my noble father's person,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
 So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
Well, sit we down,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
My tables, â€” meet it is I set it down,
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That you know aught of me: â€” this is not to do,
He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who,
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
Favour she must come; make her laugh at that. â€” Pr'ythee, Horatio,
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
 Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
For out o' doors he went without their help,
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
 For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
A bloody deed! â€” almost as bad, good mother,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
 And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
 And dupp'd the chamber door,
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
 In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
Question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
The top of mine, â€” an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
As harbingers preceding still the fates,
Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
Acts little of his will. â€” Tell me, Laertes,
What is the cause, Laertes,
And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
Good Laertes,
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
That is Laertes,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
The readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
What majesty should be, what duty is,
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
 Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, â€” he whose sable arms,
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
 About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
 With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
 But age, with his stealing steps,
And let us once again assail your ears,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Without debatement further, more or less,
Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
That I essentially am not in madness,
As one incapable of her own distress,
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
 Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
That, on the view and know of these contents,
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
If that his majesty would aught with us,
For your desire to know what is between us,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
Yet have I in me something dangerous,
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
Ah me, what act,
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
By letters conjuring to that effect,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
To lay our service freely at your feet,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
O, throw away the worser part of it,
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
It beckons you to go away with it,
Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Let us haste to hear it,
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
How in my words somever she be shent,
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
Is not to stir without great argument,
Haply the seas, and countries different,
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
A brother's murder! â€” Pray can I not,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The head is not more native to the heart,
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
Such as it is; â€” and for my own poor part,
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
To hear of it: they are about the court,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
May violets spring! â€” I tell thee, churlish priest,
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Them to their trial, the bubbles are out,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
My fate cries out,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Ophelia, walk you here. â€” Gracious, so please you,
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
My too-much-changed son. â€” Go, some of you,
Alas, how is't with you,
Mark you,
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Before my daughter told me, â€” what might you,
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
 And I a maid at your window,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
And prais'd be rashness for it, â€” let us know,
And then, you know,
 White his shroud as the mountain snow,
His beard was as white as snow,
And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
Translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
 Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
But if you hold it fit, after the play,
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
Answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
Gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
So: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
 Here stooping to your clemency,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
 He is dead and gone, lady,
 For us, and for our tragedy,
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
 For if the king like not the comedy,
We both obey,
Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
And for your rapier most especially,
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
That are so fortified against our story,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
There were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
 By Gis and by Saint Charity,
As in their birth, â€” wherein they are not guilty,
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
 A whole one, I.
My lord, not I.
[Throws up another skull].
[Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].
To Hecuba.
And let him ply his music.
Luc.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
The drink, the drink! â€” I am poison'd.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Are joyfully return'd.
Drown'd, drown'd.
Be all my sins remember'd.
A sable silver'd.
Part them; they are incens'd.
Not shriving-time allow'd.
Dead.
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
And recks not his own read.
That hath made him mad.
When second husband kisses me in bed.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
 An thou hadst not come to my bed.
To be commanded.
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
It is offended.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Stick fiery off indeed.
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
Say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
So he does indeed.
She swoons to see them bleed.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
To the unsatisfied.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
You might have rhymed.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
Which now goes too free-footed.
A document in madness, â€” thoughts and remembrance fitted.
And aunt-mother are deceived.
I was the more deceived.
 You promis'd me to wed.
Him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
Safely stowed.
By-and-by is easily said.
Come short of what he did.
Man is twice a child.
Ros. and Guild.
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
To what I shall unfold.
World.
No, by this hand.
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Into England.
For England.
Against some part of Poland.
Picked out of ten thousand.
Do, if it will not stand.
The end.
Your friend.
Perpend.
The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
Mind.
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
Upon my life, Lamond.
Choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
Friends to this ground.
Good.
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Repast them with my blood.
Should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
A churchyard.
Lord.
Lord.
Lord.
No, my good lord.
Ay, my good lord.
Nor I, my lord.
Not I, my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Very good, my lord.
There's no offence, my lord.
Come, my lord.
At home, my lord.
There, my lord.
Not a jot more, my lord.
That's very true, my lord.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
I have, my lord.
'Tis brief, my lord.
I think nothing, my lord.
As gaming, my lord.
Propose the oath, my lord.
I shall, my lord.
We shall, my lord.
Well, my lord.
Fare you well, my lord.
Very well, my lord.
Ay, very well, my lord.
I will, my lord.
We will, my lord.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
No, my lord.
We do, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
E'en so, my lord.
We think not so, my lord.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
Neither, my lord.
The actors are come hither, my lord.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
You are a good chorus, my lord.
I will do't, my lord.
It might, my lord.
I know, no touch of it, my lord.
Do not, my lord.
I understand you not, my lord.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
I shall obey, my lord.
You are merry, my lord.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
Ay, good my lord.
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Thanks, dear my lord.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Upon my sword.
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
He.
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Get you a place.
Bernardo has my place.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
On the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
As fits a king's remembrance.
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
[Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
And call the noblest to the audience.
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Which have solicited. â€” the rest is silence.
But now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
I am tame, sir: â€” pronounce.
Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
I say, away! â€” Go on; I'll follow thee.
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Continent of what part a gentleman would see.
Life.
Not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Pursu'd my life.
Shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
And prey on garbage.
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
The triumph of his pledge.
Of the unworthiest siege.
'Tis strange.
'Tis very strange.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
May sweep to my revenge.
Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
These hands are not more like.
The doors are broke.
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Nay, very pale.
As of a man faithful and honourable.
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
A more remote part of the Castle.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
A hall in the Castle.
A hall in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
A room in the Castle.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
Another room in the Castle.
Another room in the Castle.
Another room in the Castle.
Another room in the Castle.
Another room in the castle.
They shall go far with little.
Killed me.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
To speak of horrors, â€” he comes before me.
Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
My lord, you once did love me.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I pray you go with me.
Mark me.
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
And to the last bended their light on me.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
You cannot play upon me.
What thou hast said to me.
Of his affection to me.
His access to me.
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Come, one for me.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
She well instructs me.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
 By cock, they are to blame.
I can no more: â€” the king, the king's to blame.
That hath in it no profit but the name.
The very same.
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Will take longer time.
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
In happy time.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
Church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
For her perfections: â€” but my revenge will come.
He will stay till you come.
What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
You are welcome.
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
One.
And a man's life is no more than to say One.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Hamlet the Dane.
Mine.
I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
 To be your Valentine.
Then is the world one.
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
Now I am alone.
To you alone.
Why, he had none.
 At his heels a stone.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
Could not so mope.
Half a share.
Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
Our purpose may hold there.
I would I had been there.
Or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
What is the issue of the business there.
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
 Never departed more.
Would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
No more.
No more.
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
SCENE. Elsinore.
Night: you are welcome to Elsinore.
Within the centre.
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Sense.
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Still better, and worse.
A room in Polonius's house.
A room in Polonius's house.
[Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
Of his true state.
So far from cheer and from your former state.
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
Bid the players make haste.
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
I'll board him presently: â€” O, give me leave.
I pray you, give me leave.
My lord, I have.
Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
But he's an arrant knave.
And not have strew'd thy grave.
Bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
I think it lacks of twelve.
 But never doubt I love.
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
As woman's love.
Faith, her privates we.
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. â€” God b' wi' ye.
As day does to your eye.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
My head should be struck off.
Not off.
And live the purer with the other half.
The Devil himself.
Excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Observe his inclination in yourself.
Must render up myself.
Horatio, â€” or I do forget myself.
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Tell me one thing.
Nothing.
 Did nothing.
I have seen nothing.
The king.
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
But soft! but soft! aside! â€” Here comes the king.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
When thou liest howling.
In censure of his seeming.
Fear me not: â€” withdraw; I hear him coming.
His silence will sit drooping.
Not a mouse stirring.
The puppets dallying.
This is too long.
Are unwrung.
I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
Taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
To cut his throat i' the church.
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
 As if I had never been such.

What is between you? give me up the truth.
Visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
But what we do determine oft we break.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
 A very, very â€” pajock.
No, it is struck.
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Your wisdom best shall think.
Gertrude, do not drink.
Pray you, mark.
Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
A very noble youth: mark.
Couch we awhile and mark.
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Claudius, King of Denmark.
A plain in Denmark.
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Then, venom, to thy work.
To his own scandal.
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Of bell and burial.
Gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
Crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
And bear it to the chapel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
Memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.

I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
All may be well.
Love passing well.
Thou pray'st not well.
That's two of his weapons: â€” but well.
God b' wi' you, fare you well.
Farewell.
Farewell.
For England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
Nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
Sweets to the sweet: farewell.

We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Let him demand his fill.

I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
The ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
And not where I had aim'd them.
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
I pray you, now receive them.
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
Laertes, you shall hear them.
Of him that brought them.
To him from whom you brought them.
This night to play before him.
I did very well note him.
A piece of him.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Pray you, be round with him.
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
We cannot get from him.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
Well, we shall sift him.
Nay, let's follow him.
But not by him.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
The platform.
Of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
That I might be the organ.
Speak, man.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
The unseen good old man.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Most like a gentleman.
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Would perhaps trouble a woman.
A Norman.
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

The only men.
On plots and errors happen.
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
To heaven.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Let them come in.
Let her come in.
[Within] Let her come in.
No, let's come in.
Is very cunning in.
Your bounty. Take them in.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Again.
Well; â€” again.
I shall not look upon his like again.
 He never will come again.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
A Captain.
That is most certain.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Our son shall win.
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
Give us the foils; come on.
Say you so? come on.
Go softly on.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
In honourable fashion.
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Into a towering passion.
Hold up Adam's profession.
This present object made probation.
And gem of all the nation.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Amazement and admiration.
Innovation.
Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
Discretion.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Went to cuffs in the question.
That I must call't in question.
Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Ay, madam, it is common.
 And his sandal shoon.
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Fay, I cannot reason.
Denmark's a prison.
Or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
For's turn.
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
The King and Queen and all are coming down.
And break your own neck down.
As therein are set down.

'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
They are. To a nunnery, go.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
But let that go.
Be rul'd; you shall not go.
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
Question it, Horatio.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Me, whether you were sent for or no.
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
Let him bless thee too.
Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
Monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Pro.
Why, 'tis found so.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
E'en so.
'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
Promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
And let him know so.
I will say so.
Neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
It would be spoke to.
Go to.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
The tedious day with sleep.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
You mainly were stirr'd up.
O, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.
Give him the cup.

O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Bernardo, Officer.
Marcellus, Officer.
Most like: â€” it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Pluck them asunder.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Rapier and dagger.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Longer, longer.
Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
I will not speak with her.
Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
Conceit upon her father.
My lord, the king your father.
Requite him for your father.
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
My father, â€” methinks I see my father.
Most throughly for my father.
Nay, come, let's go together.
For none neither.
Dare scarce come thither.
Good night, mother.
Of my true mother.
Farewell, dear mother.
And, â€” would it were not so! â€” you are my mother.
Follow my mother.
This is too heavy, let me see another.
As kill a king and marry with his brother.
And hurt my brother.
Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.

Voltimand, Courtier.
A Gentleman, Courtier.
Guildenstern, Courtier.

Rosencrantz, Courtier.
Plunge him into far more choler.
No, my lord; rather with choler.
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
At supper.
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Master's daughter.
[Aside.] Still on my daughter.
Skull, the king's jester.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
To hear and see the matter.
This nothing's more than matter.
Think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Truly deliver.
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
If your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
'Tis gone, and will not answer.

You come most carefully upon your hour.
Of his behaviour.
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
Our duty to your honour.
I warrant your honour.
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Hold off your hands.
â€” Leave me, friends.
A worthy pioner! â€” Once more remove, good friends.
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
 And passion in the gods.
Osric and Lords.
Words, words, words.
Out of his lunacies.
None but his enemies.
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
I stay too long: â€” but here my father comes.
Where my abridgment comes.
Danes.
Danes.
Danes.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
The King rises.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
Of mighty opposites.
So fast they follow: â€” your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
O, he is mad, Laertes.
Calmly, good Laertes.
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
No, nothing but ourselves.
After the thing it loves.
Of mine own eyes.
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
To tell us this.
With this affair along: â€” or all, our thanks.
The lady protests too much, methinks.
As to peace-parted souls.
King of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
He was the first that ever bore arms.
No, by no means.
Show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

Discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
In the earth three-and-twenty years.
Thirty years.
That was and is the question of these wars.
Two Clowns, Grave-diggers.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
But keep a farm and carters.
 With true-love showers.
Players.
There are the players.
Come, sirs.
English Ambassadors.
Within 's two hours.
To both your honours.
Yours, yours.
Mess.
Mess.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
Answer, and think upon this business.
Shall be the end of my business.
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
Remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Shame and the odd hits.
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Attendants.
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
Great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
Bring him before us.
We will haste us.
Leave us.
It could not move thus.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Laertes, Son to Polonius.
Ophelia, Daughter to Polonius.
Reynaldo, Servant to Polonius.
Welcome, Horatio: â€” Welcome, good Marcellus.
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
Of blue Olympus.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
Reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
I do not think't.
On't.
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
I have sworn't.
To't.
As your daughter may conceive: â€” friend, look to't.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Nay, but swear't.
Not when I saw't.
E'en that.
Are most select and generous chief in that.
I would know that.
Is thought-sick at the act.
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
As will not leave their tinct.
 O, methought there was nothing meet.
 For such a guest is meet.
 For such a guest is meet.
Good my lord, be quiet.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Ay, Hamlet.
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, and Mother of Hamlet.
Horatio, Friend to Hamlet.
No more, sweet Hamlet.
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
Here's yet some liquor left.
Well, good night.
Ladies; good night, good night.
Give you good-night.
Give you good-night.
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
It falls right.
And vanish'd from our sight.
I never gave you aught.
Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
My lord, I did intend it.
Do not believe it.
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And will not wrong it.
No; you'll reveal it.
Good my lord, tell it.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
But truly I do fear it.
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
But that this folly douts it.
Heaven will direct it.
It will not speak; then will I follow it.
It waves me forth again; â€” I'll follow it.
We will try it.
Very liberal conceit.
Repair hither, and say you are not fit.
A hit, a very palpable hit.
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Volt.
Cor. and Volt.
Of general assault.
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.

Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
And call it accident.
I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
Sir, I lack advancement.
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
To give it due content.
Not.
I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
O, fear me not.
My lord, we will not.
Very well. â€” Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
Nay, that follows not.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
Nay, I know not.
No, indeed, are they not.
My lord, I cannot.
Believe me, I cannot.
Sir, I cannot.
My lord, from head to foot.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
Dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
Philosophy could find it out.
Treachery! seek it out.
Where is this king? â€” Sirs, stand you all without.
It. Adieu.
I'll rant as well as thou.
It would have much amaz'd you.
So, proceed you.
My leave of you.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
I beseech you.
I do beseech you.
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
But let me hear from you.
We'll wait upon you.
What I have said to you.
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.
Hath sent me to you.
This marvel to you.
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
Have sent for you.
I'll visit you.
I pray you.
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
Ay, marry, is't â€” crowner's quest law.
Know a hawk from a handsaw.
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
It is but a shadow's shadow.
Of these dilated articles allow.
Therefore let's follow.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I be so able as now.
Not that I know.
And tell you what I know.
Follow him, friends. we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Say.
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
I Play.
I Play.
I Play.
I Play.
I Play.
I Play.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
Give o'er the play.
Laertes before you fall to play.
Madam, I wish it may.
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
Look you, I'll go pray.
Very strangely, they say.
Nothing, neither way.
 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.
Top of my bent. â€” I will come by and by.
I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
Here in the lobby.
The stairs into the lobby.
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
Well, God-a-mercy.
Make you ready.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Thou know'st already.
One word more, good lady.
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
All my smooth body.
 Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.

Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
Rey.
This warlike volley.
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Humanity so abominably.
It may be, very likely.
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Yes, faith, heartily.
Sir, really.
Most free in his reply.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
Most constantly.
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
 We beg your hearing patiently.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
And the queen too, and that presently.
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Directly seasons him his enemy.
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
Sir, a whole history.
Of man and country.
Than to entreaty.
Tragedians of the city.
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Passing through nature to eternity.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To youth and liberty.
That live and feed upon your majesty.
To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
Impart a thing to you from his majesty.
Musty.
Discourse to your beauty.
In that and all things will we show our duty.
Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.

Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
Affront Ophelia:
 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
O villany! â€” Ho! let the door be lock'd:
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
And so am I reveng'd. â€” that would be scann'd:
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
With all my imperfections on my head:
I will be brief: â€” your noble son is mad:
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
My will, not all the world:
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
It waves you to a more removed ground:
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
Save yourself, my lord:
Well, my lord:
The woman will be out. â€” Adieu, my lord:
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
I pray you pass with your best violence:
We will ourselves provide:
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
Me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
Not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
It had been so with us, had we been there:
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Think it no more:
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
For this effect defective comes by cause:
And our affairs from England come too late:
For the demand of our neglected tribute:
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
As thou art to thyself:
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
This man shall set me packing:
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
For he himself is subject to his birth:
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
So levied as before, against the Polack:
 Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
Which was the model of that Danish seal:
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
'And in part him; â€” but,' you may say, 'not well:
I am glad to see you well:
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
 All flaxen was his poll:
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
 And we cast away moan:
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
But in battalions! First, her father slain:
This is the very coinage of your brain:
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
It shall be so:
I think it be no other but e'en so:
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
No, by the rood, not so:
But two months dead! â€” nay, not so much, not two:
 For some must watch, while some must sleep:
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
Kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:
It means, say you this:
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
This is mere madness:
Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss:
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
This was your husband. â€” Look you now what follows:
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
I ha't:
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
I will do't:
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
She is importunate; indeed distract:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Marry, well bethought:
Never believe it:
And draw you into madness? think of it:
Than your particular demands will touch it:
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
This grave shall have a living monument:
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
By indirections find directions out:
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And he to England shall along with you:
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
I'll warrant you:
Will not debate the question of this straw:
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Of violent birth, but poor validity:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
That can I;
No, not I;
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
To sleep! perchance to dream: â€” ay, there's the rub;
Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
Lord Hamlet, â€” with his doublet all unbrac'd;
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
My lord, I will be rul'd;
That from her working all his visage wan'd;
He is justly serv'd;
But let it be. â€” Horatio, I am dead;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
I heard thee speak me a speech once, â€” but it was never acted;
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
My lord, I did;
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
So nightly toils the subject of the land;
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
 So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
Very well, my lord;
Ay, my lord;
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
A double blessing is a double grace;
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Your leave and favour to return to France;
To offer it the show of violence;
Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
He closes with you in this consequence;
Led by a delicate and tender prince;
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
Let's follow, Gertrude;
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
That makes calamity of so long life;
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
We may of their encounter frankly judge;
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
And for his death no wind shall breathe;
Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
Would make them capable. â€” Do not look upon me;
Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;
Be as ourself in Denmark. â€” Madam, come;
I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Stay, give me drink. â€” Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
It will be short: the interim is mine;
The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
No more be done;
 He is dead and gone;
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
You are the most immediate to our throne;
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
To be contracted in one brow of woe;
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
That youth and observation copied there;
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Grop'd I to find out them: had my desire;
O, speak to me no more;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
We heard it all. â€” My lord, do as you please;
Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
The safety and health of this whole state;
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
This above all, â€” to thine own self be true;
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
'Tis most true;
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
This is the very ecstasy of love;
 Doubt that the sun doth move;
We shall express our duty in his eye;
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
If it be made of penetrable stuff;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
There is a play to-night before the king;
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
Believe so much in him, that he is young;
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
As love between them like the palm might flourish;
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
Than I to Hercules: within a month;
I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
I do believe you think what now you speak;
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
We will bestow ourselves. â€” [To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
 A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
The sight is dismal;
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
Do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;
His liberty is full of threats to all;
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
So you shall;
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
It likes us well;
My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And thus a while the fit will work on him;
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
To give the world assurance of a man;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
He closes with you thus: â€” 'I know the gentleman;
It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
And now I'll do't; â€” and so he goes to heaven;
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
Now fear I this will give it start again;
A murderer and a villain;
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
To show my duty in your coronation;
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
They had begun the play, â€” I sat me down;
That our devices still are overthrown;
O, I die, Horatio;
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
Let this be so;
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
I would not hear your enemy say so;
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
 Doubt truth to be a liar;
And foreign mart for implements of war;
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Not that I think you did not love your father;
To give these mourning duties to your father;
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
O, farewell, honest soldier;
Only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
Nay, do not think I flatter;
I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
 In general synod, take away her power;
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Hear you, sir;
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Let's further think of this;
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
O, for two special reasons;
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
 Larded all with sweet flowers;
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
 Young men will do't if they come to't;
Ay, marry, is't;
Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
That we find out the cause of this effect;
 For and a shrouding sheet;
 Methought it was very sweet;
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
I will watch to-night;
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
We would not understand what was most fit;
I am thy father's spirit;
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
Makes mouths at the invisible event;
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
In what particular thought to work I know not;
I find thee apt;
There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
This something-settled matter in his heart;
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! â€” Hold, my heart;
Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
And so have I a noble father lost;
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
He made confession of you;
There's fennel for you, and columbines: â€” there's rue for you;
The end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
High on a stage be placed to the view;
But I have that within which passeth show;
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
See you now;
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
My lord, I do not know;
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
 The hart ungalled play;
For they are actions that a man might play;
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That he is open to incontinency;
The natural gates and alleys of the body;
I embrace it freely;
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Happy in that we are not over-happy;
As England was his faithful tributary;
Purpose is but the slave to memory;
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
That they may seem the taints of liberty;
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
'The mobled queen'?
Gonzago'?
Who, I?
For Hecuba?
More, ha?
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
How now, Ophelia?
What, the fair Ophelia?
How was this seal'd?
Alas, then she is drown'd?
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
How came he mad?
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
Pale or red?
City? Are they so followed?
Know you the hand?
Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
The important acting of your dread command?
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Upon what ground?
Do you see this, O God?
With what, i' the name of God?
Have you had quiet guard?
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
How is't, my noble lord?
In what, my dear lord?
My lord?
Read, my lord?
To what end, my lord?
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
What treasure had he, my lord?
Do you know me, my lord?
Where, my lord?
What speech, my lord?
What does this mean, my lord?
What follows, then, my lord?
Will't please you go, my lord?
What is the matter, my lord?
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
What is, my lord?
What out of this, my lord?
What means this, my lord?
What news, my lord?
What, my lord?
What's that, my lord?
What part is that, my lord?
They bleed on both sides. â€” How is it, my lord?
What should we say, my lord?
How fares my lord?
Then saw you not his face?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
You do remember all the circumstance?
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
But to confront the visage of offence?
How long is that since?
Why seems it so particular with thee?
What is it you will see?
Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
What said he?
But where is he?
Is't possible?
Is't possible?
Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Stopping a bung-hole?
Can you advise me?
What do you think of me?
What are they that would speak with me?
Who is't that can inform me?
Have you forgot me?
In noise so rude against me?
Will you be rul'd by me?
O my son, what theme?
To any pastime?
Have after. â€” To what issue will this come?
I'll do't. â€” Dost thou come here to whine?
 From another one?
Must there no more be done?
O me, what hast thou done?
Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
Nor the soles of her shoe?
From top to toe?
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
Drink off this potion. â€” Is thy union here?
Peace; who comes here?
Do you see nothing there?
What, is Horatio there?
Who's there?
I think I hear them. â€” Stand, ho! Who is there?
At supper! where?
Drown'd! O, where?
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Make you at Elsinore?
You heavenly guards! â€” What would your gracious figure?
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
Good sir, whose powers are these?
When it prov'd otherwise?
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
What ceremony else?
What ceremony else?
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
The effect of what I wrote?
By the mass, I was about to say something: â€” Where did I leave?
What would she have?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Into my grave?
Pound! Didst perceive?
Receiv'd his love?
Mad for thy love?
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Is it not like the King?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Of a king?
Nay, I know not: is it the king?
Grave-making?
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
Rawer breath?
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
So bloodily hast struck?
Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
For your succession in Denmark?
How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Into a toil?
In further evil?
Did he receive you well?
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Will you two help to hasten them?
From Hamlet! Who brought them?
Ay, sir, what of him?
Is it a custom?
How now! what hath befall'n?
Was he a gentleman?
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
How does the Queen?
Will you know them then?
What woman then?
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
 And will he not come again?
 And will he not come again?
Against their own succession?
Sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
Seeks her own salvation?
What's his weapon?
Where is your son?
What shall I do?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
And in part hi;m; â€” do you mark this, Reynaldo?
Bernardo?
Between who?
Saw who?
His beard was grizzled, â€” no?
How if I answer no?
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No more but so?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
What means your lordship?
Why, what should be the fear?
Nor did you nothing hear?
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
You know the wager?
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Make up my sum. â€” What wilt thou do for her?
Father?
Where is my father?
Hither?
Why does the drum come hither?
Why he more than another?
How may we try it further?
Or for some frontier?
Galls his kibe. â€” How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
Winner and loser?
Carrion, â€” Have you a daughter?
Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
Shipwright, or the carpenter?
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
Now, mother, what's the matter?
What is the matter?
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Sir?
Are you fair?
With drink, sir?
Who commands them, sir?
Will speak to this fellow. â€” Whose grave's this, sir?
Razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
What man dost thou dig it for?
A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
More than in words?
What call you the carriages?
What is't to leave betimes?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
How is't, Laertes?
Of Laertes?
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
This?
To whom do you speak this?
Wherefore should you do this?
But where was this?
What warlike noise is this?
Alack, what noise is this?
Do you think 'tis this?
Why ask you this?
What dost thou mean by this?
Where should we have our thanks?
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
Do you think I meant country matters?
Favours?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Further trade with us?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
How long hath she been thus?
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Where is Polonius?
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Marcellus?
Strumpet. What's the news?
How now! What news?
Who is to be buried in't?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
What think you on't?
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
A Norman was't?
What?
How now! What noise is that?
Do you doubt that?
I must to England; you know that?
Believe what?
What did you enact?
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
But you'll be secret?
Hold you the watch to-night?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Where is this sight?
Bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?
Did you not speak to it?
Whose was it?
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Might it not?
It, â€” might it not?
Insert in't? could you not?
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
A face without a heart?
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Ha, ha! are you honest?
Who hath reliev'd you?
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
Arm'd, say you?
[To Guildenstern.] What say you?
Come. â€” Another hit; what say you?
Who shall stay you?
But is this law?
The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
What's the matter now?
What hour now?
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
How does your honour for this many a day?
What do you call the play?
Madam, how like you this play?
Do the boys carry it away?
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
The players ready?
How is it with you, lady?
How do you, pretty lady?
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
They?
Why?
How strangely?
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
What, look'd he frowningly?
O, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; â€” though, I
Reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I

Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
Knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
Now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
Hark you, Guildenstern; â€” and you too; â€” at each ear a hearer: that
Years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
Tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
Beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
Dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
Needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Doth all the noble substance often doubt
At gaming, swearing; or about some act
Such an act
The leperous distilment; whose effect
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Must give us pause: there's the respect
As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
Counsel. â€” Come, my coach! â€” Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
Pays homage to us, â€” thou mayst not coldly set
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
How say you by that? â€” [Aside.] Still harping on my daughter: â€” yet
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
 That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
But answer made it none: yet once methought
Sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
Imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
Excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
Sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Thus much the business is: â€” we have here writ
And I beseech you instantly to visit
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
The associates tend, and everything is bent
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Very day that young Hamlet was born, â€” he that is mad, and sent
Against the which, a moiety competent
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
That thou so many princes at a shot
Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot
Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
Have seen play, â€” and heard others praise, and that highly, â€” not
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
Looking before and after, gave us not
Continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, â€” as 'twere â€” I cannot
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
 With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
It warms the very sickness in my heart
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
Lest with this piteous action you convert
To make it truster of your own report
And gave you such a masterly report
And with a look so piteous in purport
 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
As it is common for the younger sort
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
Question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last
By laboursome petition; and at last
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
Servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
She married: â€” O, most wicked speed, to post
So to seduce! â€” won to his shameful lust
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
And either curb the devil, or throw him out
When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. â€” You
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
Them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
Given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you
My mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
Inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
There, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you
And that in way of caution, â€” I must tell you
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
For love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. â€” What do you
To know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
 The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
 How should I your true love know
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
And ever three parts coward, â€” I do not know
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
And do such bitter business as the day
 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
Away, I do beseech you, both away
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
With which she followed my poor father's body
And makes each petty artery in this body
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
Ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
Appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply
You do not understand yourself so clearly
Been struck so to the soul that presently
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers â€” if the rest of my
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
Feather. I have of late, â€” but wherefore I know not, â€” lost all my
Pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
Fortunes turn Turk with me, â€” with two Provincial roses on my

Willingly part withal, â€” except my life, except my life, except my

Heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, â€” as we have many
And hath abatements and delays as many
 Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
The violence of either grief or joy
Spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary

He likewise gives a frock or livery
Before You visit him, to make inquiry
And these few precepts in thy memory
Yea, from the table of my memory
A station like the herald Mercury
This bodiless creation ecstasy
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
From me, whose love was of that dignity
If you desire to know the certainty
Thy natural magic and dire property
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
And we did think it writ down in our duty
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
